:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

All Enphase projects adhere to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Enphase Open Source Projects.

### Languages

We accept issues in *any* language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.
