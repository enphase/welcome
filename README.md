# Welcome to the Enphase Open-Source Community
Enphase is trying to advance technology to build a sustainable future.  We believe that open-source technologies will play a key role in that future.

## Our Purpose
Advancing a sustainable future for all.
Founded in 2006, Enphase transformed the solar industry with our revolutionary microinverter technology which turns sunlight into a safe, reliable, resilient, and scalable source of energy to power our lives. Today, our intelligent microinverters work with virtually every solar panel made, and when paired with our award-winning smart battery technology, we engineer one of the industry's best-performing clean energy systems.

The Enphase Energy system enables people to make, use, save, sell, and own their power. This includes our industry-leading app, which provides unprecedented data and control in the palm of your hand. For the first time in the evolution of our centuries-old grid, people can get paid for the clean energy they produce and share with their communities, helping to build a new energy future that harnesses the sun. This clean, free, abundant source of energy can power our lives and ultimately help replace fossil fuels altogether.

Today, if you see a home with solar panels on it, there's a good chance it's an Enphase home. We have installed more than 39 million microinverters on more than 1.7 million homes in over 130 countries, helping millions of people gain access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy while creating good jobs and a more carbon-free future for everyone. Enphase is putting people and their power at the center of our shared energy future.

Enphase. Power by people.
